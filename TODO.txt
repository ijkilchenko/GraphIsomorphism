1. [LOW] Write my own ArrayList<T> class. 
2. [LOW] Maybe use the Erdős–Rényi model to generate random graphs if current simple model isn't good enough. 
3. [MEDIUM] Be able to randomly permute a given adjacenecy matrix.
4. [MEDIUM] Implement Blum and Kannan program checker for the Graph Isomorphism problem; need to think about whether or not I want to make this an object of itself.  
5. [LOW] Clean up the Node class - might have too many fields or something. 
6. [LOW] Rename variables in the Tree class and in the areIsomorphic method which have to do with spanning trees and "spanning tables."
7. [LOW] Implement my own Map<T,T> class (or use my own version of a two-dimensional ArrayList<T> class from #1).
