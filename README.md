GraphIsomorphism
================

Given two graphs, G=(V,E) and G'=(V',E'), a typical problem is to determine whether there exists an isomorphism
(a bijective function) f between V and V' such that if nodes v and u in G have an edge, then f(v) and f(u) have
an edge in G'.

Here, I am writing an original algorithm which aims to determine whether or not two given graphs are isomorphic.
